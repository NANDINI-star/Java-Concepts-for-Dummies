# Java-Concepts-for-Dummies
This is me trying to learn the basics of core Java. Once and for all ! 

I was introduced to java roughly 10 years ago in 2014( junior high school). 

So it's now or never eh?!. 🧟‍♀️

Will I do it with a credulous attitude? Not this time !  

👑 Every concept will be backed by actual code examples. Which I hope will be sufficient to use them across all Java servers/ applications.
